# Air-Quality-Prediction-with-LSTM
This project is a remote sensing based project that hopes to predict the amount of pm2.5 in the city of Tehran that is indicative of air quality of that city. In this project we got Exceptional results (R squared > 0.99) that is worth considering for future prediction and related planning.
